I am a passionate cybersecurity and machine learning researcher with a strong background in intrusion detection, federated learning. My work spans across multiple domains, from honeypot-based threat detection to SIEM integrations.
My interests also extend to galaxy clusters and radio observations, where I explore astrophysical phenomena.
