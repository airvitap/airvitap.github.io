<p>The AIR Research Lab is excited to announce the selected proposals for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025. We are thrilled to welcome our new interns who will be working on various projects that align with our research goals and objectives.
The selected interns and their respective projects are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intern Name</strong>: Sai Sanjay
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Project Title</strong>: Add Docker Swarm to Sugar</li>
      <li><strong>Organisation</strong>: Open Science Labs</li>
      <li><strong>Mentors</strong>: Ivan Ogaswara , Luis Casas ,Sandro Loch , Felipe Paes</li>
      <li><strong>Description</strong>: Find more details at [Project Link]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Intern Name</strong>: Udhay Aditya J
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Project Title</strong>: Dashbot and API Authentication</li>
      <li><strong>Organisation</strong>: API Dash</li>
      <li><strong>Mentors</strong>: Ashita Prasad, Ankit Mahato, Ragul Raj M</li>
      <li><strong>Description</strong>:  I will be developing DashBot - the AI assistant for API Dash which supercharges developer productivity by helping developers automate tedious tasks, follow best practices, interact &amp; obtain contextual suggestions, all via natural-language input. DashBot will be designed in a modular and extensible manner and provide the following list of features: 1. Explain responses &amp; identify any discrepancy 2. Debug requests based on Status codes &amp; Error messages 3. Generate API documentation 4. Understand API and generate tests 5. Generate plots &amp; visualizations for API responses along with ability to customize 6. Generate API integration frontend code for frontend frameworks like React, Flutter, etc. For each of the tasks benchmark evaluations will also be done so that it is easier for end users to choose the right backend LLM. Add support for various API Authentication Methods such as, Basic authentication, API Auth, API key, Bearer token, JWT Bearer, Digest Auth, OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We thankful to Dr Sibi Chakkaravarthy, Dr Hari Seetha for their guidance and support throughout the selection process. Their expertise and insights have been invaluable in helping us identify the best candidates for our projects.</p>
